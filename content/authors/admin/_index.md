I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the department of statistics at TAMU. My study focuses on Bayesian statistics and machine learning from a theoretical and methodological perspective. Additionally, Artificial Intelligence (particularly Reinforcement Learning) is one of my major areas of interest. I have one paper published in the AISTAT 2022 and am working on two further major projects. I am also actively seeking employment in the machine learning and finance fields following my graduation in the spring of 2023.
